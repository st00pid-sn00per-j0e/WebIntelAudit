You're facing two distinct errors — one from **Express middleware** (`express-rate-limit`) and another from **Python Playwright**. Here’s how to **fix them both**:

---

## 🔧 1. **Express `X-Forwarded-For` Header / trust proxy error**

### ❌ Error:

```
ValidationError: The 'X-Forwarded-For' header is set but the Express 'trust proxy' setting is false
```

### ✅ Fix:

You need to explicitly **trust the proxy** in Express so `express-rate-limit` can work properly.

### ➤ Add this line near the top of your Express setup:

```js
app.set('trust proxy', 1); // Trust the first proxy
```

> This is required if you are behind a reverse proxy (Replit or any hosting layer) and use rate-limiting or IP-based logic.

## 🔧 2. **Python: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'playwright'`**

### ❌ Error:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'playwright'
```

### ✅ Fix:

Install `playwright` Python module and ensure dependencies are installed **inside Replit**.

### ➤ Add the following to your `requirements.txt`:

```
playwright
```

Then run this in your Replit **Shell**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m playwright install
```

> `playwright install` is **required** to download browser binaries (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit). Without it, Playwright won’t run.

## ✅ Optional Maintenance Tip

Update `browserslist` warning by running:

```bash
npx update-browserslist-db@latest
```

This isn't critical, but helps with frontend build warnings (CSS/JS compatibility).

Once you've applied the above, re-run your app. Let me know if you want to auto-bootstrap Playwright on Replit startup.
