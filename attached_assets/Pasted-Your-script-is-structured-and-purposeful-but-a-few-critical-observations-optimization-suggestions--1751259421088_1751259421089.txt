Your script is structured and purposeful, but a few critical observations, optimization suggestions, and problem flags:

---

### 🔍 **Issues & Fixes**

#### 1. **Appium Misuse**

You're importing Appium and using `AppiumBy`, but you're not interacting with native mobile apps or actual Appium sessions. You're just launching Chrome via Selenium.

✅ **Fix:** Replace all `AppiumBy` references with `By` from `selenium.webdriver.common.by`.

```python
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
# Replace AppiumBy.TAG_NAME → By.TAG_NAME, etc.
```

> 🧠 Appium is redundant here unless you're explicitly automating mobile browsers or apps via `appium_webdriver.Remote()`.

---

#### 2. **Redundant Chrome Driver Setup Logic**

You duplicated the `setup_driver` method import block. Clean it.

```python
# Remove duplicated:
from selenium import webdriver as selenium_webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
```

---

#### 3. **Headless Browsing and JavaScript Performance**

You're using `--headless` mode. This can break some rendering or JS-heavy analysis due to headless limitations.

✅ **Suggestion:**
Test with `--headless=new` for better Chromium rendering pipeline support (if compatible with your environment):

```python
chrome_options.add_argument('--headless=new')
```

---

#### 4. **Browser Binary Search is Inefficient**

You're looping through binaries every time. Cache this or environment-variable it for performance.

✅ **Suggestion:**
Allow override via `CHROME_BINARY_PATH` env var.

```python
chrome_binary = os.environ.get("CHROME_BINARY_PATH")
if not chrome_binary:
    for binary in chrome_binaries:
        if os.path.exists(binary):
            chrome_binary = binary
            break
```

#### 5. **Security Analysis Can Be Extended**

You're only checking:

* HTTPS
* Password fields on HTTP
* CSRF tokens

✅ **Suggestions for Expansion:**

* Check for `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, `Content-Security-Policy` headers using `requests.head(url)`
* Detect inline JavaScript (possible XSS)
* Analyze cookies using `driver.get_cookies()` → `HttpOnly`, `Secure` flags

---

### 💡 **Opportunities for Optimization**

#### ✅ Use DevTools Protocol

For performance audit, skip `execute_script()` and go with Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) via:

```python
driver.execute_cdp_cmd("Performance.enable", {})
metrics = driver.execute_cdp_cmd("Performance.getMetrics", {})
```

You’ll get raw TTFB, layout shift, paint time, etc.

---

#### ✅ Compress Screenshot Payloads

Base64-encoded PNGs are large. Downscale/resample before sending.

---

#### ✅ Remove Appium Fallback Logic if Unused

```python
if not APPIUM_AVAILABLE:
    AppiumBy = None
```

Pointless if you're not using Appium sessions.

### 🔚 TL;DR - Immediate Fix Actions

| Issue                                   | Fix                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `AppiumBy` usage in Selenium-only logic | Replace with `By`                     |
| Duplicate imports                       | Clean the extra `setup_driver` block  |
| Poor header checks                      | Expand with `requests.head()` headers |
| Inefficient binary scan                 | Use `CHROME_BINARY_PATH` env          |
| Heavy screenshots                       | Downsample or limit frame rate        |

If you're targeting mobile browser emulation specifically and *not* native Android apps, you're better off:

* Using `ChromeDriver` with mobile emulation (`deviceMetrics`, `userAgent`)
* Removing Appium entirely

Want help rewriting this code for mobile emulation using just Selenium (no Appium)?
